# Network P2P Python

The socket module is part of the Python standard library, so you don't need to install any additional packages to use it

To use the socket module in your Python project

```python
    import socket
```

Each `node` acts as both a `server` and a `client`. The start_server() function starts the server and listens for incoming connections. The connect_to_peer() function allows a node to connect to a remote peer. The handle_connection() function is responsible for receiving and broadcasting messages between connected peers.

You can run this code on multiple machines, and each instance will be a node in the `peer-to-peer network`. Nodes can connect to each other by providing the `IP address` of another node.

This is a basic structure of a peer-to-peer network using `sockets` in `Python`.

Important aspects such as `error handling`, `security`, or `routing algorithms`.
